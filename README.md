### Summary

On one hand the results are not surprising: June is warmer than December. On the other hand, there isnâ€™t much difference between the two months from a statistical standpoint their average temperatures only being four degrees from one another. 

## Recommendations

Given the results the recommendation is for further analysis. We should both broaden and narrow our analysis. 

## Broaden 

Analysis should be done for all twelve months of the year to compare the average temperatures on an annual basis since the goal of this is to determine the viability of a _surf and ice cream_ shop all year long.

## Narrow

Analysis should be narrowed to specific locations on the island to see which areas are best suited for a _surf and ice cream_ shop all year long. This can be done by pulling information from specific stations. 

This information should also be targeted for the daytime. The shop will not be open all through the night so we are only interested in average temperatures from sun rise to sun set. This information will help us make a more informed decision since it will not only be specific to the possible locations but also to the times people are most likely to be on the beach looking for either a surf board, ice cream or both.
